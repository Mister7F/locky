# Todo
- download image when adding the URL on an account
- grep Todo
- improve readme
- refactor Field.svelte
- empty screen (sample data + "Create ...")
- move additional fields
- account editor: press tab go to next field instead of "Copy" button
- when entering an email, suggest existing email
- view to see duplicated password
- new folder: edit the folder in the list instead opening a dialog
  allow to edit the icon without the dialog (just a select component)
- better password generation (list of words...)
- clipboard: find a better solution (browser extension with an iframe to the Locky instance ?)
- automatically remove the clipboard after 1 minute
  (possible if the window doesn't have the focus ?)
- mobile: automatically close the session after a period of inactivity
- allow to choose theme color (change favicon ?)

Refactor
